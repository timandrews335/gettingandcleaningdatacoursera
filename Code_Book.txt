Project for Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data"

This repo consists of a code book and one R script, run_analysis.R. 
This script requires that the smartphone datasets be downloaded from UCI's website at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. The files should be unzipped in your working directory.

The single code file will perform all data processing on the UCI datasets and result in a tidy
, aggregate dataset written to your working directory. This file will be called SmartPhoneAggregates.txt.

Data was merged from UCI's test and train datasets.  For each combination
of participant, activity and mean or standard deviation observation,
a mean was calculated.

SmartPhoneAggregates.txt variables:

activity:  the type of activity that the participant was performing
	LAYING
	SITTING
	STANDING
	WALKING
	WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	
subject: identifier for the subject
	1 to 30


variable:  the observation recorded by UCI


meanValue:  the mean of each observation
